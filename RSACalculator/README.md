#  How to run

## To build from source:
### Requirements
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4 or later
- XCode 12.2
- (bonus points) iPhone or iPad to build to device

### Steps
1. Download and install XCode if not already done
2. Clone project to a local repository
3. Open the .xcodeproj file in XCode
4. Select a simulator (or physical device) in top left device selection
5. Press `play` button in top left to build and run the app


## Notes
Long term, I am hoping to get a TestFlight approval from Apple to send a public testing link for reviewers to test the app in its deployed state. Since I'm at the mercy of Apple for an approval at the moment, the next best thing would be to pull the project down and build it through XCode on a macOS computer.

If I'm able to get a TestFlight public link, I'll update this README with that information
